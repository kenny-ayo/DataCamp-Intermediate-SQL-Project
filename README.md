# DataCamp-Intermediate-SQL-Project
After taking SQL courses on Datacamp, I decided to lay my hands on the intermediate SQL Projects

Project Description
Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, you will work with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

You will look at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!
