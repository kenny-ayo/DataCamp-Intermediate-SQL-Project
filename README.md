# DataCamp-Intermediate-SQL-Project
After taking SQL courses on Datacamp, I decided to lay my hands on the intermediate SQL Projects and Joining Data SQL Projects

Topic For Intermediate SQL Project : Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result

Project Description for Intermediate SQL:

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.
In this project, you will work with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.
You will look at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!


Project Based on Joining Data In SQL

Project Title: What and where are the World's Oldest Businesses

Project Description

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, you'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?
Like many business problems, the data we'll explore is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, we will first need to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, we can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
